<h1>The Transit Droid Project</h1>

<article class="form">
In our Capstone project we developed a software system to complement the OPUS system currently used by the Société de Transport de Montreal (STM). The <i>TransitDroid</i> mobile application allows an individual to enter the public transit system using a Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled mobile device. Similar to how the OPUS card is currently used, clients hold their NFC mobile device over the reader instead of a card. For the purpose of this project we will focused on the Android operating system.
We envisioned creating an ecosystem for seamless integration of mobile devices and a web application, each used in conjunction with OPUS to manage an account from either platform. OPUS account management consists of purchasing and using transit fares as well as monitoring of one's OPUS balance.
